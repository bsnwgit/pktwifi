"""
Client-side load failures, reported back so an admin can see them.

When embed.js fails to load its script it logs once to the console and gives up
permanently — no bubble, no retry, nothing on screen. From the user's side the
feature simply does not exist, so it is never reported; from the admin's side
the Settings page says "enabled" and looks fine. The common causes are ordinary
and have nothing to do with resonance itself: an ad blocker eating third-party
script tags, a mistyped server address, resonance being down.

Rows are keyed by day + user + reason, so the table is bounded by users x
reasons x retained days rather than by how often a browser retries.
