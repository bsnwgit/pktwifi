"""
HTTP client for resonance's /embed/session endpoint.

One call, one job: hand resonance the app's key plus the identity of the user
who is asking, and get back a short-lived single-use code the browser can spend
on /embed?c=<code>. The key never leaves the server; resonance never sees the
app's own credentials.

TLS verification is always on — there is no verify=False for browsers loading
embed.js, so switching it off here would only hide a problem every user is about
to hit as a blank frame. What is configurable is which roots to trust, because
httpx verifies against its bundled certifi roots rather than the operating
system store: a certificate signed by an internal CA is trusted by every browser
on the network and still rejected here. Pass ca_bundle to use the system store
instead.
