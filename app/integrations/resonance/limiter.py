"""
Rate limiter and circuit breaker for the resonance embed client.

Both live in SQLite rather than in process memory. These apps ship with one
worker by default, but the worker count is configurable and some run more than
one — an in-process counter silently multiplies its own limit once there is
more than one, which is the failure mode where a limiter looks present and
isn't.

The breaker matters more than the limiter here. Resonance applies a geometric
per-IP backoff to repeated failed key attempts, and a pkt app calls it from a
single IP, so a misconfigured key does not degrade one user's experience — it
takes the widget down for everyone and keeps the backoff growing. Config errors
therefore open the breaker after two failures, not six.
