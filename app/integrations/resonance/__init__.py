Resonance embed integration — the shared assistant surface for pkt* apps.

This package is vendored: it is byte-identical across the pkt apps except for
APP_SLUG below. It is deliberately not a published package — install.sh builds
a venv from requirements.txt on customer hosts, and a private index would put a
credentialed network dependency in the middle of every install. Copy the
directory; bump the version when the contract changes so drift between apps is
visible.

How the pieces fit:

  browser                pkt app                     resonance
  ───────                ───────                     ─────────
  embed.js  ──GET──▶  /api/resonance/code  ──POST──▶  /embed/session
            ◀─code──                       ◀─code───
  frame ────────────────────────────────────────────▶  /embed?c=<code>

The app's own secret never reaches the browser, and resonance never sees the
app's user credentials — the app vouches for its user and gets a short-lived,
single-use code back.
