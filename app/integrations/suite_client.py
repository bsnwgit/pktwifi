"""
app/integrations/suite_client.py
----------------------------------
Base HTTP client for pktWiFi acting as a suite-token CLIENT of a sibling
pkt* app (pktsnmp, pktflow, pktlog, pktpcap). This is the mirror image of
app/api/suite.py (which is the INBOUND side — pktHub calling into pktWiFi).

Every pkt* app's get_current_user() dependency trusts three headers when
they're present and X-Suite-Token matches that app's own configured
suite_token:
  X-Suite-Token — the token copied from that app's Settings -> Integrations page
  X-Suite-User  — an identity string (shows up as the "user" in that app's audit trail)
  X-Suite-Role  — admin | analyst | viewer — mapped to that app's local roles

No login/JWT dance is needed — the token itself is the credential, same as
how pktHub proxies requests to every app it manages.
