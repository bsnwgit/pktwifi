"""
app/api/resonance.py — the pkt* side of the resonance embed contract.

  GET  /api/resonance/config  — what the SPA needs to mount the widget. Never the key.
  GET  /api/resonance/code    — cookie-authenticated. embed.js calls this itself.
  POST /api/resonance/report  — a browser telling us the widget failed to load.
  POST /api/resonance/test    — admin. A real session call; renders what the key grants.
  GET  /api/resonance/status  — admin. Breaker state and recent load failures.
  GET  /api/resonance/docs    — suite-token. This app's documentation, for
                                resonance to hold as the assistant's knowledge.

Why /code authenticates by cookie when everything else here uses a Bearer token:
embed.js fetches data-code-url on its own, outside the SPA, with
credentials:'include'. The app's access token lives in memory by design, so there
is no way to attach it to a fetch this app does not make. The refresh cookie is
the only credential the browser will send — it is validated the same way
/api/auth/refresh validates it, and deliberately not rotated here.

That makes this the one cookie-authenticated route in the app, so it does not
rely on SameSite alone: Sec-Fetch-Site and Origin are both checked before the
cookie is honoured.
