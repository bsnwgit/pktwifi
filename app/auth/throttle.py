"""
Per-address throttle on failed sign-ins.

The account lockout (app/auth/lockout.py) stops one account being guessed at.
It does nothing against one address trying many usernames, or a few passwords
across many accounts. This counts failed credential checks by the address they
came from, whatever username was tried, and blocks the address for a while once
it has made too many.

Three settings, all editable under Settings -> Security -> Auth:

  address_max_failed_attempts       failures allowed from one address (default 10)
  address_failure_window_minutes    how long a failure counts           (default 15)
  address_block_minutes             how long the address is then blocked (default 15)

What counts: a username that does not exist or is disabled, a wrong password,
and a wrong current password at the change-password form. A successful sign-in
does not reset the count, so a valid account cannot be used to dodge the limit.
A request for a locked account is not counted: it is refused before any
password is checked.

The address is the one the connection came from. Behind a proxy on another
host that is the proxy's address, so every user behind it shares one count; a
deployment like that should raise the limit, or throttle at the proxy. This
code does not read X-Forwarded-For (any client can send it); uvicorn applies it
itself only for a proxy on the same machine.
