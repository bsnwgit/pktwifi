# pktWiFi uninstall script — Ubuntu Server 22.04/24.04 LTS
# Usage: bash uninstall.sh [--purge] [--yes] [--dry-run] [--dir <path>]
#
# Removes the systemd unit, the application code and the virtualenv.
#
# Data is KEPT by default — config.yaml (which holds the JWT secret and the
# credential encryption key), pktwifi.db and its -wal/-shm, logs, backups and
# any TLS material uploaded through Settings. Re-running install.sh over the
# top therefore resumes with the same database and the same admin password.
# Pass --purge to remove that too; it is not recoverable.
#
#   --purge      also delete config.yaml, the database, logs, backups, ssl
#   --keep-data  the default; stated explicitly for scripted runs
#   --yes        don't prompt (required for --purge non-interactively)
#   --dry-run    print what would be removed, change nothing
#   --dir PATH   install directory, if it can't be read from the unit file
#
# The install directory is discovered from the installed systemd unit's
# WorkingDirectory, then $PKTWIFI_INSTALL_DIR, then /opt/pktwifi.
